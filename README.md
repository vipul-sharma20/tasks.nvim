## How it works

Tasks are markdown checkboxes with a `#task` tag and optional metadata:

```markdown
- [ ] #task Ship the API changes  [due:: 2026-03-25]  [priority:: high]
- [/] #task Review PR from @loremipsum  [due:: 2026-03-24]
- [x] #task Fix auth middleware  [due:: 2026-03-20]  [completion:: 2026-03-21]
- [-] #task Migrate to Redis (cancelled)
```

Statuses: `[ ]` todo · `[/]` in-progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` cancelled

Tasks can link to note files for context:

```markdown
- [/] #task Refactor payment service [[tasks/refactor-payments]]  [due:: 2026-03-25]  [priority:: high]
```

The linked file (`tasks/refactor-payments.md`) holds whatever context you need:
description, links, subtasks, scratch notes. Press `<CR>` on the task to
view/edit it inline in the dashboard float.

## The Dashboard

`:Tasks` opens a floating window with your tasks grouped by urgency:

![Dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)

`📎` means the task has a linked note. `j`/`k` skip between tasks.

Press `<CR>` on a task to open its note inline, editable in the same float.
`:w` saves and returns to the task list. `<CR>` again opens it in a full
buffer.

## Dashboard Keymaps

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `x` | Mark done |
| `p` | Mark in-progress |
| `-` | Mark cancelled |
| `<Space>` | Mark todo |
| `e` | Edit task (description, due date, priority) |
| `<CR>` | Open note context inline (creates note + wiki-link if none exists) |
| `o` | Jump to source file at the task line |
| `n` | Create new task |
| `/` | Fuzzy search (fzf-style bar, filters live as you type) |
| `l` | Filter by label (telescope picker) |
| `L` | Clear label filter |
| `u` | Undo last status change |
| `<C-r>` | Redo |
| `<Tab>` | Expand/collapse section |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `q` / `:q` | Close |

### Note view (after `<CR>`)

The note opens in the same floating window, fully editable.

![Note view](assets/task-expanded.png)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `:w` | Save and return to task list |
| `:wq` / `:q` | Same — save and return |
| `<CR>` | Open note in a full buffer |
| `<leader>w` | Save and return to task list |

### Search

Press `/` in the dashboard. A search bar appears above the float. Type to
fuzzy-filter across task descriptions, dates, priorities, and tags. `<CR>` or
`<Esc>` accepts the filter and drops you back into the filtered list. `<C-c>`
clears the filter. `<Esc>` in the dashboard clears an active filter.

## Labels

Tag tasks with `#projectname` to group them by project:

```markdown
- [ ] #task #api-team Deploy API service  [due:: 2026-03-28]
- [ ] #task #otel Estimate timelines for OTel migration
```

Press `l` in the dashboard to open the label picker (telescope-powered,
searchable). Select a label to filter and the dashboard switches to a
status-grouped view showing all tasks for that project: In Progress, Todo, and
Done.

![Labels](assets/labels.png)

Press `L` to clear the filter and return to the default urgency view.

## Inline rendering

`#task` and `#label` tags are highlighted in the buffers in normal mode.

![Task highlighting](assets/task-highlighting.png)

Highlights clear in insert mode so you see the raw markdown while editing.

## Inline toggle

`<C-Space>` on any `#task` line in a markdown/vimwiki buffer cycles the status:

`[ ]` → `[/]` → `[x]` → `[-]` → `[ ]`

Falls back to `VimwikiToggleListItem` on non-task lines.

## Query blocks

> [!NOTE]
> I am not too sure about this feature if I'll find a need for it or support it
> going forward.

If your markdown files have query blocks like this:

````markdown
```tasks
not done
due before today
sort by due
```
````

`:TaskQuery` evaluates the nearest block and shows results in the dashboard.

Supported clauses: `not done`, `done`, `due today`, `due before today`, `due
after today`, `no due date`, `has due date`, `priority is <level>`, `sort by
due`, `sort by priority`, `(A) OR (B)`.

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.9+
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (for vault scanning)

Optional:
- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for `:TaskFind`

## Install

With packer:

```lua
use {
    'vipul-sharma20/tasks.nvim',
    config = function()
        require("tasks").setup()
    end
}
```

With lazy.nvim:

```lua
{
    'vipul-sharma20/tasks.nvim',
    config = function()
        require("tasks").setup()
    end
}
```

## Setup

```lua
require("tasks").setup({
    vault_path = "~/notes",       -- root of your markdown vault
    diary_path = "~/notes/diary", -- where diary entries live
    tasks_path = "tasks",         -- note files dir (relative to vault_path)

    sections = {
        { name = "P0 (Overdue)",  query = "not done\ndue before today\nsort by due" },
        { name = "P1 (Due Today)", query = "not done\ndue today\nsort by due" },
        { name = "All Pending",   query = "not done\n(due after today) OR (no due date)" },
    },

    symbols = {
        todo        = "✗",
        in_progress = "◐",
        done        = "✓",
        cancelled   = "●",
    },

    width  = 0.6, -- float width as fraction of editor
    height = 0.7,
})
```

All fields are optional. Defaults are shown above.
